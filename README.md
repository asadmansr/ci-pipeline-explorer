Inspired by [Sarah Drasner's array explorer](https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer), CI Pipeline Explorer is an interactive tool to quickly explore the right commands for your GitLab CI/CD pipeline. However, the tool is not a replacement for the official documentation provided by GitLab and only serves as a quick guide with a few tips/tricks to help developers get started with their CI/CD pipelines.

Explore and Enjoy!
